You'll need an embeddings file to get started. The pre-built models use this one:

Decompress the embeddings file first.

Feature generation: embprox.py <textfile>, which expects files to have the name actionability.[letter].train

Classification: predict.py <model file> <featurefile>

Model training: build-model.py <featurefile>

Evaluation & development: see xeval.py
